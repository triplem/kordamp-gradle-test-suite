== Testing

This project was used to show-case the problem with `jacocoRootMerge` (or `jacocoRootReport`) with a gradle project configured in kotlin DSL.
It turned out that the JavaPlugin applied to the general `plugins` section was causing the problem with the inital version of the JacocoPlugin.

See https://github.com/aalmiray/kordamp-gradle-plugins/issues/198 for reference. Commit 9dfd519ba30c170bdc06f57bcfcf57f21868265c resolved the issue.
