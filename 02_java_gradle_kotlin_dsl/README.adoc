= Project Description

* gradle configuration with kotlin DSL syntax
* java projects
* project1 with production code, a dummy unit test and an integration test
* project2 with integration tests testing the production code from project1
* project3 with functional tests testing the production code from project2

Note: The dummy unit test in project1 prevents `gradlew jacocoRootReport` from failing
due to missing `subprojects\project1\build\jacoco\test.exec`.

== Testing

Commands expected to succeed:

```
gradlew clean check
gradlew clean allTests
gradlew clean aggregateJacocoMerge
gradlew clean aggregateJacocoReport
gradlew clean allJacocoReports
```
